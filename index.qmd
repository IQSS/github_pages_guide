# Preface {.unnumbered}

The following is a quick starter guide designed to get you acquainted with GitHub Pages, an option for you to create a personal website.

We include directions for editing your website with three options:

1. The online file editor through GitHub
2. GitHub Desktop
3. RStudio and Git

Feel free to choose the option that best fits your technical comfort level. If you are already used to R/RStudio/Git, the third option may be best for you. If you don't know what those are, feel free to use either of the first two options.
