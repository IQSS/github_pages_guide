# Getting Started {.sec-google}

If you don't want to code at all, the Google Sites option is best for you!

To get started, you only need to ensure that you have a Google Account (e.g., a gmail account). If you do not have one, please make one at [accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com/signup).

Additionally, before you get started, it would be great to have the following easily accessible to add into your website:

* A professional biography
* A headshot, if you have one
* Your CV or resume (PDFs are best!)
* Research interests and projects
* Contact information (e.g., your professional email, social links if you post on X or BlueSky, your GitHub, etc.)
