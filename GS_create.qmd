# Creating Your Website {.sec-google}

Creating your website with Google Sites is as easy as clicking a button. Simply go to [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com) (you may be prompted to log in, if you are not already). 

Under "Start a new site" there is a list of templates. Feel free to browse the templates before you select which one you'd like to use. We suggest either:

* "Graduates" or
* "Professors"

Once you select the template you'd like to use, Google Sites will redirect to a customizable version of the template for you to edit.
