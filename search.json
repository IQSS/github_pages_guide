    "text": "To create a personal website with GitHub, you must already have a GitHub account. If you do not, please make one.\nThese instructions largely follow the instructions from GitHub, found here.\n\nIn GitHub, create a new repository called username.github.io where username is replaced by your actual username.\n\n\nFor example, if my username is pandabear, my repository is called pandabear.github.io\n\n\nOn your desktop, create a folder. I called mine “Personal_Website”\nIn Visual Studio Code on the Welcome Page, click “Clone Git Repository…”\nCopy the full repository link from your GitHub repository using the clone button. Paste this into the search bar that appears in Visual Studio Code when you clicked “Clone Git Repository”\nSelect the folder (“Personal_Website”) as the destination, and click “Open”\nIn your Workspace Pane (the left) you should see that it now says the name of your repository at the top (USERNAME.GITHUB.IO).\nNow, select “New File…”\nType html into the search bar that popped up.\nMake sure that the destination is the name of your repository (this will be in your “Personal_Website” folder if you want to double check).\nName it “index.html”\nInside the file, copy and paste this text:  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;  &lt;html&gt;  &lt;body&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m hosted with GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt; \nSave your file.\nClick the Source Control icon on your left-hand toolbar. (It has three nodes, and resembles a branch icon).\nYour file index.html should be listed under “Changes”. When you hover over this file, three icons will appear. Click the + button. Now, the file should be listed under “Staged Changes”.\nClick “Commit”. A file will open inside VSCode with a gray line 1. Write your commit message: “Initial Commit”.\nClick the checkmark at the top right toolbar. A dialog box will appear.\nClick Save. The dialog box and the commit file will disappear.\nThere should now be nothing to see in the Source Control pane. Click the three dots in its menu toolbar.\nClick Push. This will send your code/files to the GitHub repository.\nCheck in your GitHub repository to make sure that the commit is pushed. You should see index.html with the commit message that you gave it.\nCheck your actual website by going to username.github.io. It should say (in very basic styling):\n\nHello World\n\n\nI’m hosted with GitHub Pages.\n\nNow that our site is hosted correctly, we can actually build our site to look how we want it!",
