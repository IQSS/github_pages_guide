# Adding a Custom Domain {.sec-customizing}

Customizing your domain name can be a complicated process. The full GitHub instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

These instructions assume that you already have ownership of the custom domain that you would like to use, as well as knowledge about your specific DNS provider.

<ol type="1">
  <li> Go to your GitHub repository </li>
  <li> Click Settings </li>
  <li> In the left-hand menu bar, select Pages </li>
  <li> Scroll down to the Custom Domain section </li>
  <li> Enter your custom domain in the textbox. For example, you should write: mysite.com </li>
  <li> Hit Save </li>
  <li> Navigate to your DNS provider and create a CNAME record that points your subdomain to the default domain for your site. 
  <ol type="a">
    <li> Example: if you want to use www.example.com, you will create a CNAME record that points www.example.com to \<username\>.github.io. Note that this is the user page, not a repository name. </li>
    <li> Instructions for creating a CNAME record vary by DNS provider. GitHub recommends using your DNS provider's documentation . </li>
    <li> For example, on GoDaddy, when you add a record, the record name would be "www" and the record value would be "username.github.io" </li>
  </ol>
  <li> To ensure that your apex domain (i.e. without "www") works, you should also include four A records in your DNS provider's web console. For example, on GoDaddy, the name would be the \@ symbol and the values would be the following: </li>
  <ul>
    <li>185.199.108.153</li>
    <li>185.199.109.153</li>
    <li>185.199.110.153</li>
    <li>185.199.111.153</li>
  </ul>
  <li> Confirm that your DNS record is configured correctly using the terminal.
  <ol type="a">
    <li> In the terminal, type: dig WWW.EXAMPLE.COM +nostats +nocomments +nocmd where WWW.EXAMPLE.COM should be replaced with your custom domain name. </li>
    <li> You should see the GitHub pages link in the output. </li>
    <li> This can take some time to propogate </li>
  </ol>
  <li> Go back to your GitHub repository. </li>
  <li> Go to Settings > Pages > Custom domain </li>
  <li> Check off Enforce HTTPS </li>
</ol>
